# Consistent Localization Dream Drop Distance HD (Hide Game Settings UI)

This mod is part of a series intended to make subtle adjustments to the English localizations of the Kingdom Hearts games so that they better align with one another.

This is an alternate version of [SuperfieldCU/ConsistentLocalizationDDD](https://github.com/SuperfieldCU/ConsistentLocalizationDDD) that provides compatibility with the [Hide Game Settings UI](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomheartsdreamdropdistancehd/mods/20) mod by Saro. Use this version and only this version if you are also using that mod, and use the other version and only that version if you are not.

## Installation

Mod can be installed using the OpenKH Mod Manager. Simply open the Mod Manager, click the green + button, type `SuperfieldCU/ConsistentLocalizationDDDHGSUI` into the text box, then click `Install`.

## Info

The GitHub version of this mod functions identically to using the .dddpcpatch version of the mod on Nexus Mods (this is in contrast to the KH2 version of Consistent Localization, where the .kh2pcpatch version and GitHub versions function very differently). Use whichever you'd like, although this version gets automatic updates and looks better within the Mod Manager interface.

The mod was developed and tested using the OpenKH Mod Manager. It works both with patching the files directly and using Panacea. It is tested and confirmed to be compatible with Re:Fined v3.15.

## Links
The four playable games in the Kingdom Hearts HD I.5+II.5 ReMIX collection and Dream Drop Distance HD are supported by the OpenKH Mod Manager and can install mods directly via GitHub repos. This means that the Consistent Localization mods for these games can be installed either through GitHub or with patch files downloaded from Nexus Mods, and (other than KH2) should produce identical results regardless of which is used (although using the GitHub version is generally recommended). The remainder of the mod series cannot be directly installed via GitHub repos and there's not yet a compelling reason to host them anywhere but on Nexus Mods.
